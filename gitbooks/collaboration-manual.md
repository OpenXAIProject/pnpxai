* Document your chosen task by creating an issue in the Git project.
* Provide a clear description of what you plan to accomplish.

### 3. **Referencing Documentation**

* If additional information is required, refer to the documentation available on GitBook.
* In case of specific queries or if you need expert guidance, proceed to create a 'question issue' directed to the responsible person or team.

### 4. **Completion and Updating Documentation**

* Once your task is completed, update the relevant sections in GitBook.
* This ensures that changes and new information are easily accessible to others.

### 5. **Handling Critical or Discussable Issues**

* Should you encounter any critical issues or topics that require team discussion, promptly raise them in the Git project.
* Make sure to share and highlight these issues in the Group Meeting for further deliberation and collective input.

**Note**: Open communication and regular updates in the Git project are crucial for smooth workflow and team synergy.
