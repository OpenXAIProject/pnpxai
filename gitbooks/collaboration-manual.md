## Workflow Guidelines

#### 1. Decision Making

* Begin by deciding on the task you need to undertake.

#### 2. Issue Creation

* Document your chosen task by creating an issue in the Git project.
* Provide a clear description of what you plan to accomplish.

#### 3. Referencing Documentation

* If additional information is required, refer to the documentation available on GitBook.
* In case of specific queries or if you need expert guidance, proceed to create a 'question issue' directed to the responsible person or team.

#### 4. Collaboration and Task Ownership

* Respect task ownership: Do not alter or complete tasks assigned to other team members without their consent.
* If collaboration or assistance is required, seek permission through a comment on the issue or direct communication.
* This is to avoid conflicts between codes.

#### 5. Working with Branches

* Create a new branch for your task, branching off from the main development branch.

#### 6. Creating Pull Requests

* Once your task is completed, create a pull request against the main development branch.
* Clearly describe the changes made and link to the corresponding issue for context.
* Assign or request reviewers for your pull request. A minimum of one or two reviewers, depending on the project's complexity, is recommended.

#### 7. Review and Merge Protocol

* Do not merge your pull requests. Wait for reviews and approval from assigned team members.
* Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and approve changes only when they meet the projectâ€™s standards and guidelines.
* If changes are requested, address these revisions in a timely manner and update the pull request.

#### 8. Completion and Updating Documentation

* Once your task is completed and the pull request is merged, update the relevant sections in GitBook.
  * You can do it by revising the documentation in gitbooks directory. It is not free to edit the Gitbook in Web UI for more than 2 members. Please notice that update of documentation in Gitbook should be on the `gitbooks` branch
* This ensures that changes and new information are easily accessible to others.

#### 9. Handling Critical or Discussable Issues

* Should you encounter any critical issues or topics that require team discussion, promptly raise them in the Git project.
* Make sure to share and highlight these issues in the Group Meeting for further deliberation and collective input.

#### 10. Continuous Communication

* Maintain open and continuous communication with the team.
* Regularly update the status of your tasks and any challenges you face in the Git project.

#### Note

* Open communication and regular updates in the Git project are crucial for smooth workflow and team synergy.
* The workflow is designed to foster collaboration while respecting individual responsibilities and maintaining a high standard of quality.
