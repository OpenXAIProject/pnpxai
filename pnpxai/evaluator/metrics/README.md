# Evaluator

The Evaluator module provides several metrics to evaluate the result explainations generated by `explainers`. Based on Co-12 properties [1], correctness, continuity, compactness, and completeness are chosen. Currently one metrics for each properties are implemented except completeness.

## Properties of evaluation
| Property [1] | Explanation | Corresponding Metrics | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Evaluates the truth/reliability of the explanation of the prediction model (AI model). In other words, it indicates how truthful the explanation is compared to the behavior of the black box model. Moreover, it evaluates the degree to which a prediction model (AI model) is explained. | Mufidelity, Area between Perturbation Curves | [2], [4] |
| Continuity | Continuity assesses how continuous (i.e. smooth) the description is. High-continuity explanation functions ensure that small changes in the input do not lead to large changes in the explanation. | Sensitivity | [3] |
| Compactness | Evaluates the size/amount of explanation. Ensure that you do not present complex and redundant explanations that are difficult to understand. | Complexity | [2] |


## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

from pnpxai.utils import set_seed
from pnpxai.explainers import LRP, ExplainerWArgs
from pnpxai.evaluator import Complexity

from helpers import get_imagenet_dataset, get_torchvision_model

set_seed(seed=0)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# load model, dataset, and explainer
model, transform = get_torchvision_model("resnet18")
model = model.to(device)
explainer = ExplainerWArgs(
    explainer=LRP(model=model),
    kwargs={"epsilon": 1e-6, "n_classes": 1000},
)

dataset = get_imagenet_dataset(transform=transform, subset_size=8)
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8)
inputs, targets = next(iter(loader))
inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)

# make explanation
attrs = explainer.attribute(inputs, targets)

# test evaluator
metric = Complexity()
evaluations = metric(attributions=attrs)
print(evaluations)
```
